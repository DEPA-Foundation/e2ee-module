End-to-End Encryption Module

Building an open source E2EE module will create positive externalities for the DEPA ecosystem. 

For starters, building an open source encryption module will provide security benefits in the form of deeper oversight. As open source enthusiasts know, enough eyeballs make all bugs shallow. Having more developers vet the encryption libraries will certainly help eliminate bugs.

Secondly, having a high quality open source encryption module will reduce the technical and security overhead for companies wishing to implement their own cryptography. If an easy to use open source library is available for DEPA specific use cases, it has a good chance of becoming a standard. If most participants of the ecosystem  use the same crypto library, we can reduce the risk of code incompatibility and code customization.
